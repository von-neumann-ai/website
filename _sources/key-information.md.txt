# Key Information

In case the customer doesn’t own a domain, we assign a free subdomain to the customer. Multiple users can access the system. Customer can easily add additional users to each application as required.

50% of the price is paid when order is placed and 50% when the system is delivered and setup. Delivery will be done in 2-3 days. Installation procedure will be scheduled with the customer and will be completed in a day.
