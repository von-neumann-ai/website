JOHNAIC comes with following hardware:

* Intel i5 12400 CPU
* Intel Arc 770 16 GB GPU
* 64 GB RAM
* 1 TB SSD
* 1100 VA UPS (optional)

Its peak rated power draw will be 500W. Using UPS, the system will be powered on for about 15
minutes if thereâ€™s a power outage. Customer should ensure the power is back on within 15
minutes for best experience. We also recommend connecting their Wifi router to this UPS for
uninterrupted remote access. If wifi router can not be moved, a UPS for wifi is also sold
separately.
